## Notes

This repository grew from my work for the course AADS at the UG. The textbook used for this course is *Introduction to Algorithms* by Thomas H. Cormen, et al. The third edition of this textbook will be referred to as CLRS³, and the fourth edition as CLRS⁴.

The aim is to implement all the algorithms and data structures discussed in this textbook, along with a few other algorithms and data structures that are not discussed or merely referenced. All implementations will be in C, and will follow the pseudocode in the textbook as closely as possible.

All solutions to the textbook's exercises can be found on [this site](https://walkccc.me/CLRS/), although these are not always optimal or correct.
