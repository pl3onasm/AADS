# Bubble sort

Bubble sort is a simple algorithm that sorts an array $A[0:n-1]$ in ascending order by moving, for each index $i$, the minimum element in the subarray $A[i:n-1]$ to the front and eventually swapping it with $A[i]$. Getting this minimum element at index $i$ requires a pass through the subarray from $n-1$ down to $i$, swapping adjacent elements as necessary (i.e. if they form an inversion). This is also where the name comes from: as we keep swapping from $n-1$ down to each $i$, smaller elements "bubble" to the front of the array, similar to bubbles rising to the surface of a liquid. It is also sometimes referred to as *sinking sort*, since larger elements "sink" to the bottom of the array, which is the part of the array that is sorted first if we work the other way around, i.e. from $0$ up to $n-i-1$.

Bubble sort is an in-place sort, meaning that it does not require any additional memory. It is also a stable sort (since we only swap adjacent elements if they are out of order), meaning that elements with the same value will retain their relative order after sorting. It has a worst-case running time of $O(n^2)$, due to the nested loops, even if the array is already sorted. A small optimization can be made by keeping track of whether any swaps were made during a pass through the array. If no swaps were made, then the array is already sorted and the algorithm can terminate early. This reduces the best-case running time to $O(n)$.

Note the difference with [selection sort](https://github.com/pl3onasm/CLRS/tree/main/algorithms/sorting/selection-sort), which also finds the minimum element at each index, but does so by performing a linear search for the minimum through the current subarray $A[i:n-1]$ and only swapping the found minimum with $A[i]$ at the very end of each pass without any intermediate swaps, thus making it an unstable sort.
