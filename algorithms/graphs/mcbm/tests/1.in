CLRS‚Å¥ Figure 25.1

The numbers in L could be numbers identifying 7 persons, 
and the numbers in R could each identify books in a library 
that are available for loan. 
The edges in the graph could then represent the books that 
each person would like to read. These edges are unweighted: 
each person wants to read each book they've listed with  
equal preference.
The maximum cardinality matching ensures that as many 
persons as possible get a book they want to read.
