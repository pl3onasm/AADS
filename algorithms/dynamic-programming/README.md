# Dynamic Programming

Two main properties should be satisfied in order to apply dynamic programming:

1. <ins>Optimal substructure</ins>  
   The optimal solution to a problem consists of optimal solutions to its subproblems.
2. <ins>Overlapping subproblems</ins>  
   The same subproblems are encountered multiple times during the solution of a problem. To improve efficiency, the solutions to these subproblems should be stored and reused.
