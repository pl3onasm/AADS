# Dynamic Programming

Two main properties should be satisfied in order to apply dynamic programming:

1. **Optimal substructure**  
   The optimal solution to a problem consists of optimal solutions to its subproblems.
2. **Overlapping subproblems**  
   The same subproblems are encountered multiple times during the solution of a problem. The solutions to these subproblems are stored and reused.
