# 0-1 Knapsack Problem

The problem is to find the maximum value of items that can be put into a knapsack of a fixed size. The knapsack can only hold a fixed number of items, and each item has a weight and a value. The items can't be broken up into smaller pieces, and each item can only be used once.
